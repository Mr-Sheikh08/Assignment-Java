                                         Assignment-(Operators and Loops)- 28/01/23

Ques-1 - What are the conditional operators in Java?
Ans- When a condition consists of multiple boolean expressions, they are used .Use conditional 
        operators to combine two expression, such as when we wish to print a number only if it is larger
        than 2 and less then 5, respectively.

Ques-2- What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans- There are three types of operators-
            Logical-and operator(&&)
            Logical-or operator(II)
            Ternary operator(?:)

Ques-3-What is the use of switch case in Java programming?
Ans- Lets say we have a variable , Now we want to do multiple operations on it based what value what value it is storing. 
        In such cases the switch statement into play.
        
        It is like an if else ladder with multiple conditions,where we check for equality of a variable with various values.

Ques-4- What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
Ans-  Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra,
         The following table list the arithmetic operators.
            (+,-,*,/)etc

Ques-5-What are the conditional statments and use of conditional statement in Java?
Ans- They are used when condition comprises more then one boolean expression, For instance, if we want to print
         a number only if it is greater then 2 and less than 5 then we will use conditional operators to combine the 2 expression 
        There are three types of conditonal statement --
            Logical -and(&&)
            Logical-or (||)
            Ternary (?:)
 
Ques-6- What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans-     if (condition - 1) {
                   statement - 1
           } 
           else if (condition - 2) {
                   statment - 2
           }
           else {
                  statment - 3
           }

Ques-7-What are the 3 types of iterative statement in Java?
Ans- Iterative statements is loops, there are three types--
            The while loop
            The for loop
            The do-while loop

Ques-8-Write the differnce between for loop and do while loop?
Ans-  Loops-
           Loops in java is a feature used to execute a particular partof the program repeatedly if a given conditions
           evaluates to be true.

        Do-while loop--
         do while loop is test for the condition at the end time of each execution for the next iteration in other words, 
         the loop is executed at least once before the condition is checked other then that everything is the same as in
         the while loop.

Ques-9- Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans-  
               class print number {
                 public static void main (string [] arge){
                 int x=1;
                while (x <= 10 ) {
                             System.out.print(x + " ");
                  }
                  }
                   }

     Output-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
